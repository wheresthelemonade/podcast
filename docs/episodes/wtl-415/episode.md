Some of it from personal experience. Some of it by watching other tourists standing out. :)</div><div>Second Half of Portugal</div><ul><li>Sintra and Cascais- Wear great walking shoes. Dress in layers. Rain, no rain, rain, hot, rain. Lots of hills to climb on cobblestone streets and sidewalks.</li><li>Lisbon on a Sunny Saturday. Incredible city. Very crowded. Everyone in Portugal was there when we were there. Must see the Monastery of Jeronimo, eat at Pastéis de Belém, Pastels de Nata (egg tarts), and walk along the Tagus River to the Tower of Belem. Walk the Rua Augusto near the Praca do Commercial. Too much to see in one day.</li><li>Beach cities - Peniche, Nazare, and Praia Del Rey</li><li>The hunt for a porcelain platter&nbsp;</li><li>Church on Sunday/ A family moved to Portugal from the states 5 years ago. Great to hear their story.</li><li>Lisbon Temple on Saturday</li></ul><div>Don'ts When You Travel</div><ul><li>Don't order the food they aren't known for and expect it to be good. Mexican food in Poland.</li><li>Don't go to big cities on Saturdays with good weather.</li><li>Don't try and park in downtown Lisbon.</li><li>Don't rely on your mobile phone service. Don't stay in the passing lane on the freeway. Everyone in Europe moves right (Except in the UK) except to pass.</li><li>.Don't get offended when someone honks at you.</li><li>Don't be afraid to wear comfy shoes.</li><li>Don't ignore your concierge. Don't be rude to anyone.</li><li>Don't be too loud. Notice what other people are doing and pay attention. Poland is a peaceful country.</li><li>Don't be afraid to make new friends and talk to people.</li><li>Don't forget sunscreen</li><li>Don't forget to put on sunscreen that is in your backpack</li><li>Don't forget to take a backpack with you.</li><li>Don't park where you are not supposed to. You will get a ticket.</li><li>Don't get a speeding ticket. Many European countries send you a ticket in the mail months later.</li></ul><div>Lemonade Moment of the Week</div><div>While Darren &amp; Paige were in Portugal, one of the kids had an incident with the car. Everything was fine, and a friendly neighbor was there to help the situation.</div>
