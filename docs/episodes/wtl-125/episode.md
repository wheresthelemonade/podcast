So that problem is not common for everyone.</li><li>In our situation, Darren did not move, some friends had to take sides.</li><li>It will be hard to have a friend still be both of your friends. You have put them in the middle of your mess. Not fair. You need to let them go sometimes.</li><li>Sometimes you might lose a friend because "divorce is contagious". It is very hurtful. But you need to be understanding.</li></ul><div><strong><br>How to Make Friends in your Spouses Circle of Friends<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Church Friends, Soccer mom friends, that you might have in common with your spouse's ex.</li><li>Three sets of friends.<ul><li>Your friends - Your exes friends - Friends with both parties.</li><li>Be respectful of your exes friends, boundaries are good.</li><li>Be understanding of your friends, they are trying to navigate the situation the best they can.</li><li>Venting to a person might seem ok but who do they talk to and who talks to them. Word gets out very fast in a small community. Be careful to only vent to one or two people who you can trust and know that they will not share what you have told them with anyone.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Communicating with the friend network can be difficult.<ul><li>When you travel in the same circles and have common friends make sure you are communicating really well with your ex, for your friend's sake.</li></ul></li></ul><div><strong><br>Being Friends of a Divorced Couple<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Both get invited to a party by the same person.

We feel for you.</li><li>Don't get your feelings hurt if someone does not come to the party, lunch, or soccer game.</li><li>We have invited two couples that are exes, to a party just recently, without thinking about how it might affect them.&nbsp;</li><li>Be supportive, try to understand that you cannot understand what they go through until you have gone through it.</li><li>Realize that all words spoken will go to the other side of the relationship. Be respectful and speak kind words.</li><li>If you are friends with both sides, you need to figure out who needs you at the moment.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong><br>Lemonade Moment of the week<br></strong><br></div><div>At a wedding of Darren's niece, Paige accidentally wakes up Darren at 1:30 am in the morning trying to find her purse that she did not bring on the trip...</div><div><strong><br>Links<br></strong><br></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sc-fam-divorce-contagious-0821-story.html">https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sc-fam-divorce-contagious-0821-story.html</a></li></ul><div><br></div><div><br><br></div>
