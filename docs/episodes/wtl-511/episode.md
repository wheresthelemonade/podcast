summary: "Darren and Paige have heard about Nacho parenting and always thought it was definitely not for them, but they only had heard about extreme Nacho parenting. After a dive into what it really is, Paige is not totally against it; she can see why some families would adopt this type of parenting in a blended family."

After a dive into what it really is, Paige is not totally against it; she can see why some families would adopt this type of parenting in a blended family. So let's take a look.</div><div>Definition of “Nachoing”:<br>People often ask, what is Nachoing? The Facebook response is usually “Nacho Kids, Nacho Problem.” Well, not quite. The stepkids can definitely be a problem for you. It’s “Nacho Kids, Nacho Responsibility.” The stepkids are not the responsibility of the stepmom/stepparent.<br>The Nacho Kids method is a philosophy and methodology for blended families that consists of proven techniques and strategies, the psychology of human interaction, the mind, personalities, personal life experiences, and a track record of positive client results.<br>“Nachoing” as it is often referred to as, or using the Nacho Kids method, is stepping back from situations that cause you and/or your blended relationship stress and realizing when you feel you have “no control,” you actually have the ultimate control. And that is how you let it affect you.</div><div>Nachoing is to:<br>• Treat the stepkid as you would a friend’s kid.<br>• Allow the bio parent to parent their own kid as they deem fit.<br>• Not engaging in negative and unhealthy interactions with the stepkids.<br>• Act as a babysitter in the absence of the bio parent.<br>• Say nothing about, or to, the stepkids unless it’s sheer praise.<br>• Remove the target off your back and no longer be the “bad guy.”<br>• Have no interaction with your significant other’s ex (the other bio parent).<br>• Let go of the things you cannot control and realize the ultimate control is to control how you let these things affect you.<br>• Help the stepkid if they ask you for help. That help can be by responding with, “Go Ask Your Dad.”</div><div>A breakdown of the Nacho Kids method:<br>• Understanding you are not their mom legally, biologically, nor through osmosis or a genie in a bottle. They have a mom and a dad, and you are neither.<br>• Learning how to step back from the chaos.<br>• Identifying your personal triggers, the roots of those triggers, and how to avoid/cope with “unhealthy” interactions.<br>• Understanding why the blend is so hard and how even our minds play against the blend being successful.<br>• Focusing on your blended relationship or marriage, not the stepkids or your significant other’s ex.<br>• Being supportive of your significant other in their parenting role. It’s their job to parent. It’s your job to be their partner.<br>• Creating the “stepparent” role that works best for you and your blended family.<br>• Re-engaging with the stepkids in the role you designed to fit your blend!</div><div>Lemonade Moment of the Week:</div><div>Great trip with the kids to Italy. Hard time adjusting the the time change when they got back.</div>
