Neurotransmitters may be to blame.</li></ul></li></ul><div><strong><br>How to help your Spouse<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Hard to know what to do when your spouse is depressed.</li><li>Sometimes they want to talk to you about it, sometimes not. It is hard to tell. Be patient.</li><li>Open Communication is key. If you have already established a strong open communication then you can more easily talk about their depression.</li><li>Do not judge, just be patient and try to lift the day to day burdens they might have.&nbsp;</li><li>Know when it is time to help them get out of bed. With kindness</li><li>Read the environment, find out what helps. The little victories are really big.</li></ul><div><strong><br>How to help yourself<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Gratitude Journal, focusing on the positive things in life is important to overcome the feelings of hopelessness that you may be experiencing.</li><li>Take care of yourself, exercise, get outside, eat well.<ul><li>A simple walk around the block can do wonders for you.</li></ul></li><li>Change the lighting in your house. More windows, light with broader spectrum mimics sunlight.</li><li>Get good sleep.</li><li>Serve other people.</li><li>Forgive yourself and others.</li><li>Reach for a higher power.</li><li>Seek a good therapist that teaches you techniques not just listens to you complain.</li><li>Seek medical advice. Find out what is really going on. Blood work might be needed. We found a functional doctor that looked at all of your systems was best.&nbsp;</li><li>Do NOT be afraid to be on medication if necessary. No shame in being on medication.</li><li>Find a little thing that you can accomplish. Just to make you feel like you did something productive. Ironing Darren's shirts or doing the laundry.</li></ul><div><strong><br>Funny Moment of the Week<br></strong><br></div><div>We are headed on a family trip which includes an airplane flight from San Fransisco to Boston. We were talking to the kids about what they are most excited about and David our youngest said he is very excited to sit next to a stranger on the airplane. :) So whoever was in seat 25F from SFO to BOS, hope you had a good time sitting next to a 12-year-old boy that wanted to talk. :) &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong><br>Links<br></strong><br></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314698.php">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/314698.php</a></li><li><a href="https://adaa.org/finding-help/helping-others/spouse-or-partner">https://adaa.org/finding-help/helping-others/spouse-or-partner</a></li><li><a href="https://www.psycom.net/help-partner-deal-with-depression/">https://www.psycom.net/help-partner-deal-with-depression/</a></li></ul><div><figure data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:320,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IQnXvTK0yrU/XLQbxHy1pkI/AAAAAAAEy74/APv1tGhpMPMs3tp0ClOMT0ck-R8WyBksQCK4BGAYYCw/s320/20190410_193433.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:240}" data-trix-content-type="image" data-trix-attributes="{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Waiting to enter Pink Concert&quot;}" class="attachment attachment--preview"><img src="./image1.jpg" width="240" height="320"><figcaption class="attachment__caption attachment__caption--edited">Waiting to enter Pink Concert</figcaption></figure><br><br><br></div><div><figure data-trix-attachment="{&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;image&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:320,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-siFeUYX-vGU/XLQb809TVTI/AAAAAAAEy8A/EjSWeX5DAIQunOA2JC004t0O4q5x8Ai9ACK4BGAYYCw/s320/20190410_195638.jpg&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:240}" data-trix-content-type="image" data-trix-attributes="{&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Nice kiss at the concert.
