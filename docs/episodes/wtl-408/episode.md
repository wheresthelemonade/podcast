<html><head></head><body><div>This week Darren &amp; Paige explore selfishness in Marriage with a quiz. Are you selfish in your marriage? Is your marriage about you or about your spouse?&nbsp;</div><div>Are you selfish???&nbsp;</div><ul><li>We are all selfish, right? Especially before marriage. We only have ourselves to think about. What do I want to eat? What do I want to spend my money on? What music or show do I watch?</li><li>After marriage, those I's have to become we(s)...This might be harder for some than others. You have to now think of someone else and merge your lives with compromises and solutions that work for you.</li><li>Obvious signs of selfish behavior: It's all about you! Think you are better than your spouse. Controlling. Don't give or share. Will not compromise. Blame your spouse for everything that goes wrong. Forgiving is difficult. Think that your spouse's feelings matter less than yours. Competing.</li><li>Harmful effects of selfishness: Creates hurt feelings and resentment. Communication issues. Arguing. Prevents you from thinking the best about your spouse. Doesn't build trust. Marriage will become stagnant.</li></ul><div>How to Overcome Selfishness in marriage</div><ul><li>1. Be responsible and admit you are selfish.</li><li>2. Communicate with your spouse about your selfish behavior. Find a balance where you can compromise and decide who gets to pick what.</li><li>3.
