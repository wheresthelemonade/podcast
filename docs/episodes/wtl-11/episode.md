<p>﻿1</p>
<p>This is Darren and this is Page,and this is where's the lemonadewhere we try and figure outwhat to do with those lemonsthat are thrown at us or thrown at us.</p>
<p>Makes them lemonade, maybe.</p>
<p>I guess it depends on the week for sure.</p>
<p>In this episode, we're going to talk aboutwhy we're doing this podcast.</p>
<p>Why are we? I'm not exactly sure.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll figure it out. Sounds good.</p>
<p>So just a little bit about ourselves.</p>
<p>This is Darren and this is Page.</p>
<p>And after 20 years of marriage, we bothfound ourselves divorced and alone.</p>
<p>Yeah, we did.</p>
<p>It was a it was a tough time.</p>
<p>Very. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think anyone that's gone throughthat can relate to that.</p>
<p>Emotional turmoil and physical turmoil,</p>
<p>Everything that goes goes on in them.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's. It's difficult.</p>
<p>Difficult for the grown ups.</p>
<p>It's difficult for the kids.</p>
<p>It's just, you know, it's a bummer.</p>
<p>It's a major bummer.</p>
<p>That'swhen lemons are thrown at you, right?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes. So after some time, we.</p>
<p>We actually.</p>
<p>You'd been dating longer than I had.</p>
<p>And we actually met online.</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>In fact, you were the first personto flirt with me online.</p>
<p>Yes, I remember.</p>
<p>I was kind of burntout of of the online thing.</p>
<p>And I hadn't been on in a long time.</p>
<p>And I got on after a few months of a breakand there wasyour picture popped up and it said,you have a new member in your area.</p>
<p>So I sent you a little smiley face with awith a.</p>
<p>It was a flirt, you know, Flirt.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>And apparently, you hadyou had just gotten outjust five men on 5 minutes to spendall the time Photoshopping my picture.</p>
<p>That was 18 months old.</p>
<p>It wasn't 18.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was 18 months old. Huh.</p>
<p>And how many people?£30 lighter than what I was.</p>
<p>It was still me, though.</p>
<p>Bait and switch, but that's okay.</p>
<p>Just a little bit.</p>
<p>But it was. It was fine.</p>
<p>So I remember that the first date thatwe went on, it was really hard for me.</p>
<p>It's scary after,you know, 20 some odd years of,you know, Yeah,not doing that kind of thing.</p>
<p>And all suddenyou are doing that kind of thing.</p>
<p>It's it is.</p>
<p>It's weird and awkward and and Yeah,but we did.</p>
<p>In fact, we were.</p>
<p>I was your first date. Yup.</p>
<p>You were not my last.</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>Because I did not want to bethe rebound girl.</p>
<p>No. So she actually insistedthat I date other girls,and he took that very seriously.</p>
<p>I had no problemonce I got used to it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I had no problem dating other girls.</p>
<p>Yeah, In fact, he was dating so many,he had to keep a spreadsheetto keep us all straight.</p>
<p>I actually did.</p>
<p>It's different when you're olderand there's kids involved becauseyou have something to talk about.</p>
<p>It's. They're each other's kids.</p>
<p>The family is so important to usand so whenwhen you start talkingabout other people's families,keeping all the namestrue, it's really, really difficult.</p>
<p>Oh, it sounds like it was a hard timefor you, dear.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>I hardly got any sleep at all, rather.</p>
<p>But when we finally decided,hey, this is this is something serious.</p>
<p>This is something we want to to carry on.</p>
<p>We had to talk a lot about Whendo we introduce the kids to each other?</p>
<p>Yes, we were.</p>
<p>We had to make sure we were very seriousbefore we did that, because you don'twant to just throw the kids into,you know, a not serious relationship.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because the kids become easily attachedto who you're dating.</p>
<p>And and it you break it off.</p>
<p>It can be pretty hard for them.</p>
<p>So before we introducethe kids to each other, we were datingonly late at night, basically afterwe would put the kids to bed.</p>
<p>Kids to bed? Yeah.</p>
<p>Then we would,you know, hang out at Walmart.</p>
<p>We had nowhere to go.</p>
<p>We couldn't go to WinCo movie theaters.</p>
<p>I would periodically have to goshopping at 10:00 at night.</p>
<p>My older kids were like, Oh, you have togo get chocolate chips again, Dad.</p>
<p>Yep, I'm off to get chocolate chips.</p>
<p>Don't wait up for me.</p>
<p>Yeah, Those chocolate chips are hiddenat the grocery store, apparently.</p>
<p>Yes, they are.</p>
<p>They take a long time to find so funny.</p>
<p>But we were throwing my six kids.</p>
<p>And your four kids all together. Yes.</p>
<p>And if people did not just addthat up. Yes.</p>
<p>We have ten children together.</p>
<p>In fact, when I started datingyou and I was telling my friendsabout you and your six children,they all said, run, run, run away.</p>
<p>Why would you get involvedwith somebody with six kids?</p>
<p>And I you know, I didn't feel like</p>
<p>I could be that that pickyand that choose, you know, when you'retrying to find someone with all the ages.</p>
<p>Took one day with meshe was she was I was smitten.</p>
<p>But do you know what I mean? You you can'tyou know, you have so many boxesyou want to check off, right?</p>
<p>When you're looking for someoneand you're looking for a good matchfor yourself and your family and your kidsand that's very different.</p>
<p>It's different. And so you.</p>
<p>I didn't feel like I could go, Nope,</p>
<p>You can't have more than you know,you can't have allyou can only have two kids.</p>
<p>You can only have brown hair.</p>
<p>You know, I just felt like</p>
<p>I had to be a little more open than that.</p>
<p>So only brown hair.</p>
<p>I have white hairand I have since we've been married.</p>
<p>So anyway, I did not run away.</p>
<p>No, you did not.</p>
<p>I stayed. Yeah, And I'm glad you did.</p>
<p>Well, great. I am. I'm very glad.</p>
<p>That's good to know.</p>
<p>So when when we actually got married,we actually had eight kids at home.</p>
<p>One was just getting readyto leave on a two year mission.</p>
<p>Right. So that was all chaotic.</p>
<p>And then then we had seven kids at homeliving with usat seven different schedules,at five different schools.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was it was crazy. It was crazy.</p>
<p>So we learned a lotfrom that blending experience.</p>
<p>And that's why we're doing this podcast.</p>
<p>Yeah, to just share our experiences.</p>
<p>We are not experts on anything at all.</p>
<p>Far from it.</p>
<p>You know, we're learning every day, butit's just we're hereto share our experiences.</p>
<p>And if somebody, someone out therecan benefit from listening tohow we're getting through things,then I'd be very happy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I, you know,with with all the at the beginning,with all that goingon, you were working as a bank teller?</p>
<p>No, I was working as a.</p>
<p>Oh, that's right. Banker.</p>
<p>My personal banker, actually. Yes.</p>
<p>I have been promoted to banker.</p>
<p>You were my personal bank.</p>
<p>I was your first.</p>
<p>How many accounts did we open up?</p>
<p>Oh, gosh, I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah, it was in the Wells Fargo days, So,yes, we had to open so many accounts.</p>
<p>That's all done now. Butyeah, Iremember you were really sadthat you had to quit your banking job.</p>
<p>That is sarcasm in his voice.</p>
<p>No, I was not sad at all,but I did enjoy working.</p>
<p>But that was ait was a very stressful job.</p>
<p>A very stressful job.</p>
<p>So but we didn't we really didn't see how.</p>
<p>There was no way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, Darrenmade a lot more money than I did.</p>
<p>So it was a it was a no brainer that</p>
<p>I stay home.</p>
<p>But with sevenkids, seven different schedules,there was just practicallyno way that I could have.</p>
<p>I remember we were eating two dinnersand I</p>
<p>Yeah,because the kids were in swim and swim.</p>
<p>It was it was a really crazy time.</p>
<p>But we made it through it.</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>We did.</p>
<p>We we just kept on goingand kept on going.</p>
<p>We found some lemonadeevery once in a whilewhen it was more rarein those days to have lemonade.</p>
<p>So we're going to talk about some ofthose things in some of our episodes.</p>
<p>But it's funny because some of ourfriends are married friendsthat had gone through divorce.</p>
<p>They were watching us go through thisand they didn't know what to do. No.</p>
<p>And they even though they triedto be there for you and it's difficult.</p>
<p>It's difficult for thembecause they really can'thave the empathythat someone that has gone throughit will have so much as ourour friends try to be there for us.</p>
<p>It was they really couldn't understand.</p>
<p>Yeah, they couldn't understand.</p>
<p>So that's yeah, that'sone of the reasons we're doingthis is so that, hey,maybe they can hear our storynow that it's been some yearssince that's passed, you know,we have a little bit more perspective.</p>
<p>We're not in the throes of everythinggoing on, butwe also found other friends that have gonethrough the same thing as us.</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>And I think there's a little bit of pull,you know, too, towards those people.</p>
<p>When you meet someone and go,oh, you've you've been through this too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you know, and we have some closefriends that are, you know, acouple of years in front of us as far asthey don't have any kids at home anymore.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they went throughblending big families together.</p>
<p>So it's it's interesting talking to them,getting advice from them and tips.</p>
<p>And so we want to sharethose tips with more people.</p>
<p>And we know our our situationis pretty unique with such a big family.</p>
<p>But I think there's a lot of good tipsthat we learned along the way.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And people are always curious when theyfind out about our family situation,about how we are doing this,and we seem to be fairly happy doing it.</p>
<p>I think so. I mean, you know,we definitely have our moments inour days where things are notexactlyperfect, perfect, but it's never perfect.</p>
<p>You know, one of the things we learnedwas to laugh a lot.</p>
<p>Yes, that helps out quite a bit.</p>
<p>That does that.</p>
<p>That is actually very helpful.</p>
<p>You just have toto try and see the positive or the,you know, the the fun in it. Yes.</p>
<p>You know, whatever it is, sometimesit's laugh or cry.</p>
<p>And I'd always rather laugh.</p>
<p>And we play a lot of music.</p>
<p>Music is big.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's big in this house.</p>
<p>You're not ever find usgetting ready for school.</p>
<p>We ready for the day Without music.</p>
<p>Without music on itjust tears up the whole mood.</p>
<p>And if someone's really grumpy,all you have to do is turn some musicon and start dancing and everythingcalms down, right?</p>
<p>Especially eighties music.</p>
<p>It absolutely works every time.</p>
<p>Absolutely works every time.</p>
<p>But we're we'rethe show format is all about thingsthat we've learned.</p>
<p>So each episode as we go through thiswe'll talk about in depthone of one of the different thingsthat we've doneor that we've learnedis something that happened that week.</p>
<p>As we're still in the middle of this.</p>
<p>We still have kids at home.</p>
<p>Two of them are mine and one is yours.</p>
<p>And they're only, what, eight months apartbetween the three of them.</p>
<p>So yeah, just about.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So yeah, we've got 12, 13, 14,almost 14 year old in the house.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So have the three amigoswe like to call them. Yep.</p>
<p>And these three are really interesting.</p>
<p>They've all grown up together. They.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Where The older kids really, they kind ofgrew up but some were already gone.</p>
<p>Some of them were whilewe had a little bit of time left.</p>
<p>But it's interestingto see how things changedover these last yearswith the difference in the kids.</p>
<p>So we have several topicsthat that fit the kids in well,not just the kids,but our lives that have changed over time.</p>
<p>But we want to talk about those topics.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, there's it's funny,when we first sat down to make a listof all the topicsthat we could oh, my goodness,you know, have episodes on for a podcastbecause I was thinking, oh, you know,is there enough? Yes, there are enough.</p>
<p>And oh my goodness, we just kept writingand writing and writing topics.</p>
<p>I mean, one of themthat we'll be covering,you know, at some point is the scheduleswe mentioned that there were seven atwill, eight but seven kids really at homeand that seven different schedules.</p>
<p>And that was crazy.</p>
<p>We had you created a calendar with yeah,we use Google Calendar,which was a shared calendar.</p>
<p>My ex could see where the kids were.</p>
<p>She could put things on there.</p>
<p>It was the only waywe can keep things straight.</p>
<p>But everybody has their own color.</p>
<p>Everyone have their own color.</p>
<p>The older kids that had phones had theirschedule, they could make changes to it.</p>
<p>We could see what was going on.</p>
<p>It really saved us at the beginning.</p>
<p>Yes. Yeah, it really did.</p>
<p>You have to be so much more organizedwhen you're a blended familyand are having that many kids.</p>
<p>Yeah. Keep track of. Well, yeah.</p>
<p>And there were a lot like not only justkeeping track of the schedules,but having that many kidsfrom different familiesand with different expectationscomingall into one family was was difficult.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things wasyou like a clean picked up house.</p>
<p>Yes, I do.</p>
<p>And youwanted it clean all the time.</p>
<p>And it was like a horde of elephantscoming home every day from school,not all at once, but it took like an hourand a half to get everyone home, right?</p>
<p>Well, and they would walk in and there'sseven backpacks and, you know, shoes.</p>
<p>Everybody walks in, dropstheir backpack, kicks off their shoes,opens up their homework, get stuff out.</p>
<p>All the teenage boysread the refrigerator,everyone's in the kitchen getting a snack.</p>
<p>And I'm just kind of freaking out, going.</p>
<p>In fact, I remember I came home once.</p>
<p>You were upstairs in your room crying.</p>
<p>There were some tears involved,and all seven of my childrenwere in the family roomwatching TV with all of their stuff.</p>
<p>With all their stuff laying about. Yeah.</p>
<p>And I went upstairs,asked you how you're doing.</p>
<p>I could tell how you were doing.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know exactly what I was doing.</p>
<p>I came downand I think I shocked all of the children.</p>
<p>Yours and mine both.</p>
<p>Yes. I think that I could hear youfrom upstairs through my tears.</p>
<p>Even I could hear you.</p>
<p>It was important that the that the kidsall saw how important you were to me.</p>
<p>Your kids and my kids both.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I'll tell you what.</p>
<p>Since in our househas always been picked up and not always,but it's a battle every day.</p>
<p>But you have to see I'm torn.</p>
<p>That's where I attribute you. Yes.</p>
<p>The kids on top.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And Paige stays on top of the kids? Yes.</p>
<p>When they comein, they know what the rules are.</p>
<p>And if they don't do it,</p>
<p>I mean, it's like instant.</p>
<p>Yes, we address it right away. Not later.</p>
<p>And our house.</p>
<p>Our house is always picked up.</p>
<p>It is there.</p>
<p>They they are so good at it now.</p>
<p>In fact, so muchso that even the neighbor kidsand you would wonderwhy would you have neighbor kids over?</p>
<p>Oh, we love having people over.</p>
<p>Oh, there are kids here all the time.</p>
<p>Sometimes</p>
<p>I think we have more than ten kids.</p>
<p>Oh, I love it.</p>
<p>But even the neighbor kids come overand it's really funny.</p>
<p>They walk in the front door, they'll comehome from school, come to our house.</p>
<p>No, hang their backpacks up, take theirshoes off, put them in the Cubbies.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And you even had some of your friends hereand their kids have walked inand done this.</p>
<p>And they're like going, What in the world?</p>
<p>They don't do that in our house.</p>
<p>I'm like, Well,you haven't gotten mad at them, I guess.</p>
<p>Yeah. Or it's just consistency.</p>
<p>It's consistency and they know thatthey can go in the kitchen.</p>
<p>I'm very free.</p>
<p>They can have a snack, you know, I'm veryfree with what they do in the kitchen.</p>
<p>As long as and all the neighborhood kidsknow, all of our kids know they clean itup, they haveto put their dish in the dishwasheror I don't do dishes in the sink, ever.</p>
<p>Those are not in the sink.</p>
<p>So it's interestingbecause that consistency that wasand we're going to talk about thatin one of our episodes.</p>
<p>So the topic of consistency in discipline,consistency and house rulesand things like that are extremely.</p>
<p>Yes, Yeah, that'll definitely be a topichow we handle discipline withyou, with your kids.</p>
<p>I mean, with my kids, that's,that's a whole Well,and then also the three amigosthat have been raised together. Yes.</p>
<p>Because they were little.</p>
<p>They were little.</p>
<p>So they they only know they really onlyremember this kind of life.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>Our blended life,which is, you know, it's good and bad.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And one of the topics we will alsodiscuss iswhen I met you,you had just bought this houseand it was a large houseand a seven bedroom.</p>
<p>So it I needed enough for my kids right?</p>
<p>Yes. Yes.</p>
<p>And so I moved in to your houseand I felt like a guest in the beginning.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah,</p>
<p>I can imagine you were, but I had nothing.</p>
<p>Is this is a blank canvas canvas.</p>
<p>I was literally in this housesix months. Yeah.</p>
<p>Before we got married.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>It was a blank canvas waiting for me.</p>
<p>Except for one area.</p>
<p>Well,you just told me there was one picture.</p>
<p>You said I could do whatever I wanted,but there was one picture that you did.</p>
<p>That's my George Washington picture.</p>
<p>And I love that picture.</p>
<p>Valley Forge picture.</p>
<p>So but so I have traveled a lotthroughout my career, and I've captureda bunch of little trinketsfrom every place I've gone.</p>
<p>So piece of the Berlin Wall, some other,you know, trinkets from Japan and Chinaand South America.</p>
<p>And I had them allin the entertainment center in the familyroom, and thingsstarted disappearing from there.</p>
<p>And I didn't know where they were going.</p>
<p>Well, just one at a time.</p>
<p>I had a strategy.</p>
<p>Yes, because you told me</p>
<p>I could do whatever I wantedand you didn't careexcept for that one picture.</p>
<p>So I would take away onetrinket at a time and put it away,thinking maybe you wouldn't know.</p>
<p>I didn't want to hurt your feelings,but I also you a wait I had in my mindhow I wanted to decorate the house.</p>
<p>And so, you know, it was each dayanother trinket would disappear.</p>
<p>And then one day I was like, Forget it.</p>
<p>And I just took them all down.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the only time</p>
<p>I recognize that anything was gone.</p>
<p>I went, Well, where did everything go?</p>
<p>You know?</p>
<p>But it was fine because I realizedhow you were feeling in this houseand you have made it.</p>
<p>You've made it our home.</p>
<p>Yes, it's our home now,but that's a whole topic.</p>
<p>We will discusshow how you go from feeling like a guestin your own familyto being part of the family.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And that being part of the familyis another topic we talk about.</p>
<p>It's a we have to remember thatour kids are not ours.</p>
<p>Yeah, they are oursand and someone else's too.</p>
<p>So we have like pictures of our familiesbefore we were divorced.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And they're in the house, our exes and.</p>
<p>Yeah, and the kids thereand they're on the wall.</p>
<p>The kids see them. We talk about it.</p>
<p>It's importantthat they have a feeling of belonging.</p>
<p>We don't ever want the kids to thinkthat we are trying to forgetabout that part of our livesbecause we are not.</p>
<p>That was, you know,</p>
<p>I will never regret that time of our life.</p>
<p>It was wonderful.</p>
<p>We you know, those are well,it's it's who makes us who we are,who we are and who the kids are.</p>
<p>And so we definitely like tocelebrate our past, not try and forget it.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p>So and then also another interesting thingwhen you when you first came over,</p>
<p>I mean, the swim thing was crazy becausewe had all of our all my kids swimming.</p>
<p>So swim was at the worst timepossible at dinnertime. Oh,terrible.</p>
<p>And also it was a little difficultat first learninghow to cook for nine, ten people.</p>
<p>Well, I didn't know because when I movedin with you, I only had two kids at home.</p>
<p>My oldest two were already at college,and so I was used to cooking forjust us three, whichthere wasn't a lot of cookinggoing on at all because I guess Sam was sosmall, was small, and I was workinguntil 6:00, so I didn't go home till 630.</p>
<p>I was exhausted.</p>
<p>I the last thing I wanted to do was cook.</p>
<p>So we were having,you know, frozen food or whatever. Butso I wanted to impress everyonewith these lovely meals that I would makeand she'd cook for an hour.</p>
<p>There was there was plenty of food. Yes.</p>
<p>I mean, Darren would come home from workand he would see thismassive casserolethat I and he was like, Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>And I'm like, Is this too much?</p>
<p>I don't know. We'll find out.</p>
<p>And frankly, the boys at the time,we have, what, three teenagers swimming.</p>
<p>They could have eaten everythingthat we cooked.</p>
<p>Yes, Yes.</p>
<p>But I'm the only one.</p>
<p>Well, yeah,there's only a couple of us in the family.</p>
<p>I like leftovers.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's not you.</p>
<p>You really like leftovers.</p>
<p>And I like leftovers for lunch,</p>
<p>But maybe not for dinner.</p>
<p>Yeah, Yeah. So? But we figured it out.</p>
<p>We figured it out just in timefor us to have only three kids at home.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I.</p>
<p>So, you know, we share the cookingquite a bit, actually,but that's a whole nother topic.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Cooking and planning for,you know, kids for half the time and kidsfor all the time.</p>
<p>It's because we have Darren'skids half the time,and we have my kids 100% of the time.</p>
<p>So we never are alone by ourselves.</p>
<p>We always have kids, which is, you know,that's what normal people.</p>
<p>That's when all families have their kidsall the time.</p>
<p>Well,then we talk about time spending alone.</p>
<p>In fact, in our next episode,you guys will hear abouthow important it is to spend alonetime together.</p>
<p>Yes, that is that is a very importantthing to do in a second marriage. Andyeah, we we relish that time together.</p>
<p>We absolutely doand enjoy every minute of it.</p>
<p>But yeah, that's our next hour.</p>
<p>Yeah. So yeah.</p>
<p>So tune in to our next episodeto hear about that.</p>
<p>One more thingwe we've kicked this off is brandnew for us, so we'retrying to get everything all figured out.</p>
<p>We do have a Facebook page.</p>
<p>You can check it out.</p>
<p>Where's the lemonade with question mark?</p>
<p>And you can see that there arewe also have a Twitter feedwhich is w t lemonade.</p>
<p>What, the lemonade?</p>
<p>No, Where is the lemonade?</p>
<p>And and hopefully you.</p>
<p>We also have a blog out there, too,which is attachedto each one of our podcastswhere you can see picturesof what's happened that weekor the subject that we're talking about.</p>
<p>So it should be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>You're handling all that stuff.</p>
<p>I'm I'm I'm not into it.</p>
<p>Oh, you're going have to learn.</p>
<p>We will figure we will figure this out.</p>
<p>I am not a social media kind of girl,but you're you're really good at handlingthis baby. Oh, okay. We'll see.</p>
<p>Another thing that we have in eachone of our episodes isa funny moment for the week.</p>
<p>And there's loads of themand there are loads of themand I think it's been funthat we since we wrote this down, Hey,we got to have,have to have a funny moment for each week.</p>
<p>Oh, it's great,because as soon as we get onewe write it downand you know, yeah, it's great.</p>
<p>So this weekwe chose something really funny.</p>
<p>We recently saw the Lego</p>
<p>Movie, The Lego two, Sorry, Lego two.</p>
<p>The second part. Second part. Right.</p>
<p>Not to confuse with Lego two,the first partwhich hasn't been produced yet,</p>
<p>I'm sure that will be a prequel someday.</p>
<p>And our youngest.</p>
<p>Yes, he said weafter we saw the movie, we came home,we were talking about it and he said,</p>
<p>I, you know, one of the reasons</p>
<p>I really likethe Lego moviesis because they have a life message,you know, just a really good messageabout how to live your life.</p>
<p>And I said, Oh, and I'm thinking, wow, youknow, there are 12 year olds growing up.</p>
<p>He's catching on.</p>
<p>The things he can't do, his,you know, messages in the movies.</p>
<p>And so I said, Oh, that's great.</p>
<p>So what is the message?</p>
<p>He's like, I don't know.</p>
<p>So he just he heard somebody say,you know, all these movies are good.</p>
<p>They have messages in them.</p>
<p>And so he just repeated it.</p>
<p>But he has he's like, I have no idea.</p>
<p>I'm like, oh, well, we're not as far alongas we thought, but it'll get there.</p>
<p>But, you know, it is interestingbecause the message forfor that movieis kind of like the message of our blog.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's that at the end it'severything's not awesome song.</p>
<p>Everything is not always awesomeeven though I would lovefor everything to be awesome all the timebecause I do,</p>
<p>I like to have fun and be happy.</p>
<p>Like that's my thing.</p>
<p>But it's not always.</p>
<p>It's not. It's not always awesome.</p>
<p>No, but we always try and find waysto overcome that. Yes.</p>
<p>And that's why we say, Well,where's the lemonade?</p>
<p>When lemons are thrown at us,sometimes it's hard to find the lemonadeand maybe it won't be lemonade.</p>
<p>Maybe it'll just be something else.</p>
<p>And lemon zest, lemons,maybe it'll lose it.</p>
<p>Maybe it'll be lemon squares,which are delicious.</p>
<p>But it's still not what you were goingfor. Right?</p>
<p>Right, exactly. Just like, you know,we didn't expect to find ourselves.</p>
<p>And divorced.</p>
<p>No, not at all. In fact,we've said this many times.</p>
<p>We wish our kids wouldn't have ever gonethrough that situation.</p>
<p>Absolutely. And even ourselves.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>And that throws people off.</p>
<p>We don't we would not havewished this on ourselves at all.</p>
<p>And it's hard it's going to be hardfor our kids and us the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>And so, yes.</p>
<p>Do we wish that it never happened?</p>
<p>Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Even though we love each other dearlyand we can't even imagine beingwithout each other. No.</p>
<p>But if we had a choice, we wouldn'thave gone through what we went through.</p>
<p>No, no, because it really stinks.</p>
<p>But here we are, baby. Here we are.</p>
<p>So we're trying our best.</p>
<p>And we've had loads of lemonade.</p>
<p>We've hadwe have of just sucking on a lemon.</p>
<p>Yes, we have.</p>
<p>And we've had lemon squares, David,</p>
<p>Like sucking on lemons.</p>
<p>Our one son really likes.</p>
<p>Just a second, Lemon.</p>
<p>We had to stop doing itbecause it's bad for his teeth.</p>
<p>Exactly. So.</p>
<p>So anyway, so hey, maybe there's peopleout there that just want the lemons.</p>
<p>I don't know, but.</p>
<p>But we've had, you know,all kinds of happy, happy, happy times.</p>
<p>But it doesn't.</p>
<p>But it requires effort.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Right.</p>
<p>Attitude, adjustment,effort, lots and lots of it.</p>
<p>And letting some things just go.</p>
<p>Let it go. That's right.</p>
