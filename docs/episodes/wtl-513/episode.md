<summary> Podcast Transcript </summary>

<p>﻿1</p>
<p>This topic came aboutbecause you were reading your newsreelsand you read this watch and.</p>
<p>Yeah, mostly.</p>
<p>Mostly watching your newsreels.</p>
<p>And you came across this.</p>
<p>Oh, it was flame bait.</p>
<p>It was all over.</p>
<p>All over the Internet, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, It was an article aboutwhat was an article.</p>
<p>It was a real that someone had postedabout how she was at SeaWorld.</p>
<p>And she noticed thatthere is a childstanding there, a 7 to 8 year old.</p>
<p>She wasn't exactly sure.</p>
<p>Standing there next to a stroller that hadwhat she thought was aa1 month old.</p>
<p>And they were alone for several minutes.</p>
<p>And then it was like</p>
<p>So she walks over there and is like,what's going on?</p>
<p>And this little girl is like,</p>
<p>My parents are on a roller coaster.</p>
<p>And this man was like, What?</p>
<p>Well, wait, wait.</p>
<p>You said seven years old.</p>
<p>But it waswe were not sure how old she was.</p>
<p>In the article.</p>
<p>She says seven, seven, ten, nine.</p>
<p>Okay. Well, let's talk about that first.</p>
<p>Yes, there's a huge difference betweena seven year old and a nine year old.</p>
<p>Huge difference.</p>
<p>I mean, that's 20% of their life or well,what, 18% of their life to that point?</p>
<p>That's a big difference, right?</p>
<p>I mean, there's a lot of maturitybetween a nine year old and a seven.</p>
<p>Oh, I mean, huge, honestly, especiallyif she was just seven or almost ten.</p>
<p>Yeah, right. That's huge. So,</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>This lady just said a 7 to 9 year old.</p>
<p>So that yes, that is a huge difference.</p>
<p>She ends up standing therewith the little girland the newborn parents were gonefor 25 minutes.</p>
<p>So this person says.</p>
<p>Okay, so 25 minutes.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So this lady gets SeaWorldemployee involved.</p>
<p>You know,she waits until the parents get there.</p>
<p>And, you know, she'she's very upset that they've been left.</p>
<p>We're 25.</p>
<p>So we decided we would talk about this.</p>
<p>So what do you think? What what'swhat's your opinion on my.</p>
<p>First opinion is my job.</p>
<p>Mind your own business.</p>
<p>But at the same time, a seven year old.</p>
<p>A ten year old. Okay, maybe.</p>
<p>And how old was the baby?</p>
<p>How old?</p>
<p>She said she thought the baby look likea newborn, that she thought maybe a month.</p>
<p>She wasn't sure of either age.</p>
<p>She was. Yes. All right.</p>
<p>So and then sheshe said the baby was crying.</p>
<p>And and so I know.</p>
<p>That's one of those. Hard right now.</p>
<p>My first gut reaction is mindyour own business.</p>
<p>But then my my second gut reaction wouldbe, ah, then, you know, I think about it.</p>
<p>It's like, all right, you've abandonedyour child to go on a rollercoaster.</p>
<p>Hey, it's also be a really good rollercoaster.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it waswhile you like roller coasters.</p>
<p>I don't. Yeah, so.</p>
<p>But I mean, so what?</p>
<p>So the lady that posted it,obviously she was concerned.</p>
<p>Right nowthere was a lotof mixed reactions to her posting this.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>So there were reactions of what you justsaid.</p>
<p>Mind your own business.</p>
<p>Why are you getting in people's business?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I would say 80% of the reaction, though,was how dare, how dare these peopleleave their children?</p>
<p>How dare these people leave themto go on a roller coaster?</p>
<p>How selfish can you be?</p>
<p>Yes, he I had both of those emotionsin a very short period time.</p>
<p>So. Yeah.</p>
<p>So. Okay. So let's say for.</p>
<p>All right, what got one more?</p>
<p>Did she nameor take pictures of these kidsor was that on the Internetor just no story?</p>
<p>She did not know there was no nameand there was.</p>
<p>Nope, There was no gate.</p>
<p>The camera was was pacing like the groundbecause she didn't want the kids right.</p>
<p>Oh, so it was a video reel?</p>
<p>It was a video.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a video video reel.</p>
<p>And it was like facing the groundthe whole time.</p>
<p>So which was the right thing to do, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's.</p>
<p>That's different.</p>
<p>She has no businessposting. Yeah. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>These kids faces or even their parents.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>So the camera was, like, facing downthe. Whyis it so why is that so different for you?</p>
<p>Why is a video different than an article?</p>
<p>Because it makes it more real.</p>
<p>Okay. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Because if it's an article, it's postfacto.</p>
<p>I, i, i, this is what happened.</p>
<p>But a videoshe's like in the moment doing it. Yes.</p>
<p>So or.</p>
<p>Like,you know that she's telling the truthmore than an article you're like, oh, but.</p>
<p>Possibly possibly you didn't see the kids.</p>
<p>No, but I mean you you,you saw like the feet of the kid.</p>
<p>You saw the stroller,</p>
<p>Like she was just making surethat she wasn't showing their face.</p>
<p>Like.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, that that was tricky.</p>
<p>Why? Why did she get the video out?</p>
<p>Oh, well.</p>
<p>Why do you think.</p>
<p>To have something beat on on the. Ground?</p>
<p>She could get some foul.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously,if she just cared about the kids,she wouldn't have pulled her video out.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Oh, cause.</p>
<p>She, you know, wanted some of themviews of views, Right?</p>
<p>Like, you know, parents leave childrento go on roller coaster, right?</p>
<p>That's the.</p>
<p>That's the. Yeah, that's the tagline.</p>
<p>So, yes, if she just was concerned,the video would not have come out.</p>
<p>All right. But yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So let'sright or wrong, whatever she did. Yes.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let's talk about what is the youngest agethat you can leave?</p>
<p>Well, first of all, okay.</p>
<p>I want to know,would we have done something like thatif we went to that?</p>
<p>We've never been to zerowith the little kid, you and I.</p>
<p>No, no, no. We've been to Legoland.</p>
<p>We've been to Disneyland.</p>
<p>We've been to Universal. No, we wouldn't.</p>
<p>We would. I would never.</p>
<p>Know. I would never.</p>
<p>But you know what?</p>
<p>And we talked about this earlier.</p>
<p>In other countries, they leave their kidsoutside all the time. Yes.</p>
<p>Was it Finland, mainland? Yeah.</p>
<p>Like they literally the coffee shopsjust have strollers lined up outsideand they're not empty.</p>
<p>The strollers have you know,they have their babies in them.</p>
<p>It's like what is going on.</p>
<p>So yeah, that'sa they have a very safe country as well.</p>
<p>Very safe country.</p>
<p>That's something we're going to get toas well. Well, all right.</p>
<p>They have a very safe.</p>
<p>But that's also part of their culture,right?</p>
<p>You the kids don't belonginside the restaurant.</p>
<p>They bring in their strollers.</p>
<p>They're not eating.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>I mean. They're these are babies.</p>
<p>These are. Babies. They're babies.</p>
<p>They're living next doorand they're supposedly napping.</p>
<p>And it's just it's not even a thought.</p>
<p>They'reyou just leave your sleeping, baby.</p>
<p>So is it is it that our society is sooverly cautious because we'reall concerned about child abductionand things like that?</p>
<p>Is is that the case?</p>
<p>I yes. And,you know, I was just talking toone of our kidsabout this the other day,and I was saying,is there more kidnapings nowthan there was when we were kids?</p>
<p>Yeah, right. When we were kids.</p>
<p>Or is it the same number?</p>
<p>But we have the Internet now. All right.</p>
<p>So what did our kids say?</p>
<p>Every single child abductionwe know about, right?</p>
<p>I mean, if there's one.</p>
<p>Yeah, we know about itbecause we have Internet.</p>
<p>We didn't know about it before.</p>
<p>Unless you happento read it in the newspaper or write.</p>
<p>Or was on the news, it was big,you. Know, It was on the. News.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So what's the what's the what did she say?</p>
<p>Or he.</p>
<p>I don't know who you talkto. You don't. Tell me.</p>
<p>Yeah, they were like,</p>
<p>I bet there's more nowbecause we live in a scary world, right?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>So since we're talking about that,</p>
<p>I did some research.</p>
<p>Out the research departments out again.</p>
<p>Their research departmentis in the building, so</p>
<p>I didsome research on Kidnapingsand I will tell you,depending on where you look, it'skind of all over the place.</p>
<p>Like there's different statisticsdepending on which website youand it was confusing.</p>
<p>It was confusing, I will say that.</p>
<p>But you got toyou got to the real statistics though,that are that arethat are from the FBI, right? Yes.</p>
<p>I got Wikipedia, which of course that.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's. Reliable.</p>
<p>So Wikipedia says fewer than 350people under the age of 21are abducted in the street by strangersin the United States per year.</p>
<p>Now there's like 10 to 20000kids abducted,but typically by a family member.</p>
<p>In typically a parent. Yes, a parent or.</p>
<p>Right. Someone they know.</p>
<p>So that was 350.</p>
<p>Now, another site that I went to,another articlethat I believe was an articlethat was posted, and it was like onethat the FBI led me to.are abducted by strangers on averageper year.</p>
<p>Wow. That's a lotless than what I thought.</p>
<p>Yes. Still sad.</p>
<p>Very, very sad. Horrific.</p>
<p>Horrific to have that happen.</p>
<p>However, that's minusculethat you have a better chance of.</p>
<p>I don't even know, like.</p>
<p>Getting hit by lightning.</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean. It's there's lots.</p>
<p>Well, so because I did some ancillaryresearch, just yes,there were some numbers out there saying</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I you when you told me that,you told me what about this number?</p>
<p>So those arethose are people reported missing.</p>
<p>So people call and say, oh, my 15 yearold is missing and has run away.</p>
<p>Those are those are reported missing.</p>
<p>But then but real abduction.</p>
<p>But real abductions.</p>
<p>But then, you know, people call and say,oh, you know.</p>
<p>Because if you go to and there'slots of sites out there that are tryingto do the right thing and helpin these abductions and prevention.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But they put the big number up there.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So that's another interesting thingabout the Internet and all the plain baitthat's out there.</p>
<p>Instagram and Yes, and Twitteror X or Threads nowis they put that 180,000 and it's like,</p>
<p>Oh, it's fear.</p>
<p>Oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>I have a one in 500 chance or one in 2000chance of getting abductedor my kids getting up.</p>
<p>Doctor that is.</p>
<p>And that is that is you're rightthey're putting fear into your.</p>
<p>So all right.</p>
<p>If everyone knew what the real numberwas. 32.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Or let's. Say anything.</p>
<p>Yeah. Let's even make it 50.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Would people be more okay with leavinga seven yearold to watch a little baby for 20 minutes?</p>
<p>Oh, and wait.</p>
<p>I didn't finish that statistic.</p>
<p>And the statistics of stranger abductionin an amusement parkis pretty much nothing like it's really.</p>
<p>Yes, because I went furtherto look into that.</p>
<p>It's almost nothing.</p>
<p>Like there wasn't even really a statistic,because it just.</p>
<p>It just doesn't happen.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen. Well, so they.</p>
<p>Can see that because a child would startyelling or a child would.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>And there's so many strangerdanger of stranger. Yeah.</p>
<p>So they were saying those 20 to 30 kidsthat are typically kidnaped by a stranger.</p>
<p>It is usually when they're walking homealone, they're they're alone.</p>
<p>While the child from school.</p>
<p>Yes. Almost alwaysthe child is alone when they're kid.</p>
<p>So they saidto be kidnaped out in the parkor just doesn't it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>It has happened, but there's not evenit hasn't happened enough to even have.</p>
<p>To have a yearly statistics. Yeah.</p>
<p>All right. So this is really interesting.</p>
<p>If we were empoweredwith more information,would we Interesting.</p>
<p>Would we be more okay withwould there be a debate on the.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you did additional research onthere are actually laws around.</p>
<p>Yes. On on leaving children alone. Yes.</p>
<p>So I went and looked.</p>
<p>And every state is different.</p>
<p>Every state has their own laws,you know, about what?</p>
<p>What the ages.</p>
<p>And how long.</p>
<p>And for leaving your child at home.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>Most states have the law of.</p>
<p>It's the parent's decision.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Yes. There's no like, oh, 12 years oldthere.</p>
<p>There is a few states that have that.</p>
<p>But most statesit says that it is the parent's decisionbecause every child different,every circumstance is different.</p>
<p>And we have some examples of that.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>So in my kids before we got married,my kids,my second child was always left in charge.</p>
<p>Right. You have the same thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, yes, I would tell my second childthat I would tellmy oldest child that she was in charge,and then I would take my second childand go here really intact.</p>
<p>And only because not because my secondchild was super irresponsible.</p>
<p>She was just like, Hey, parents are goneand she just did her own thing.</p>
<p>You didn't really payattention to the other kidsbecause she was just doing well.</p>
<p>So we were a little more prompt.</p>
<p>We said, Matthew,you're in charge of yourself, right?</p>
<p>You're in charge of the little overkids. Right.</p>
<p>And I think downwas probably ten at the time. Yeah.</p>
<p>And we go away for a couple hours. Right.</p>
<p>And, you know,and they had our cell phone number.</p>
<p>Yes. Of course.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that's and it's personalitieslike Roblox personnel.</p>
<p>My second child, Rachel,she is a Type A personality.</p>
<p>She had to be in control. Yeah.</p>
<p>She was just like, you know,what do you need to do, Mom? I'll do it.</p>
<p>I'll make sure the doors are locked,</p>
<p>I'll cook dinner,</p>
<p>I'll clean it up like a man is likeman has such a laid back personality,which is such a blessingin so many areas of lifethat she's just like,whatever your mom is. So.</p>
<p>So I like that.</p>
<p>That it's up to the parentsand it's different for every child.</p>
<p>And it's different in situationslike if you might getthis might be called on youbecause you left your eight yearold at home with your three yearold for 10 hours.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Like, oh, that's so situational, right?</p>
<p>Like now, is that considered neglectbecause you left those two young childrenat home.</p>
<p>Now, if you left the home for an hour,</p>
<p>I don't think anybody would.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>I mean, so it's it's situational.</p>
<p>It's yeah, but on children.</p>
<p>Yeah, but so what?</p>
<p>It's not against the lawthen to leave your children in a lot of.</p>
<p>Most states it is notit is based on situation.</p>
<p>You know if the children get hurtwhile you're gone,that could be child endangerment, right?</p>
<p>It could be.</p>
<p>So you still have to be carefulbecause the police can still charge youwith something. Right.</p>
<p>And we start talking about thisin a blended family.</p>
<p>Are you more cautious about.</p>
<p>Oh, absolutely.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Because you don't want to give your exany more ammunition to go to.</p>
<p>Court. To go to custody.</p>
<p>I mean, of course,you don't want your children to get hurt,so of course you're being cautious.</p>
<p>But I think we were even more cautiousin a blended.</p>
<p>I think that's pretty normal. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, because especiallyin the early,early days of separation. Yes.</p>
<p>And things like that. Yeah.</p>
<p>Your and your lawyers are feeding this,by the way.</p>
<p>The lawyers, you know. Yes.</p>
<p>Another conflict,another six minute email, another $100.</p>
<p>There's a lot of conflict and contentionat the beginning.</p>
<p>So you are ultra cautious. Yes.</p>
<p>And you're also looking forare they doing things I wouldn't do right.</p>
<p>Or maybe together we would do.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>But individually, being ultra cautious.</p>
<p>Now we're like picking aparteverything that our ex is doing, right?</p>
<p>Like, how dare you do that?</p>
<p>Even though youmaybe would have done that.</p>
<p>But, you know, we made.</p>
<p>Our child walk home from school. Right?</p>
<p>Like these thingsthat maybe would have beenokay if you were married,but you're looking for every little thingto be upset about,especially in the early days of a divorce.</p>
<p>Yeah. So?</p>
<p>So and that's all fed by fear that we'reseeing statistics on the Internet.</p>
<p>So. QUESTION Yes.</p>
<p>How long did it take you to actuallyresearch it and find it real numbers?</p>
<p>Well, all thenumbers were numbers, but they werewere they half truths?</p>
<p>Yeah, they were. Yeah. Like the 180,000.</p>
<p>I was like, oh my gosh.</p>
<p>And then when you start reading the fineprint, it's 180,000.</p>
<p>Are the reports.</p>
<p>So I called because my child was missing,but then my child was found.</p>
<p>Yeah, he was right.</p>
<p>He was at the neighbor's house, right?</p>
<p>So his dad picked him upfrom. School yesterday, 180,000.</p>
<p>That also includesparent parental abductors.</p>
<p>So once you get into the fineprint, can only take me 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Like it's not hard.</p>
<p>But we live in such a fear based societynow, don't you think?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>We're paranoid or paranoid.</p>
<p>Yeah, we're afraid now.</p>
<p>But we have more informationthan we've ever had before.</p>
<p>And I think that's scary.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Well, so is that because people are peoplearen't researching it and they propagate.</p>
<p>They propagate lie I shouldn't saylies because that's too strong a word.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they propagate myths,appropriated data.</p>
<p>Latest example is when the news,</p>
<p>CNN and FOX both did it.</p>
<p>So both sides of the political spectrumreportedthat the straw usage in the United States.</p>
<p>Oh, you're right for that. Yeah.</p>
<p>And no one could pinpointwhere the data came from.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And the straw manufacturers are like,no, we don't produce a half a trillionstraws.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So where are they all.</p>
<p>Like we actually did.</p>
<p>Exactly. Nice.</p>
<p>And it came because of a fourth gradereport up in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>And I'm like, oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>Is no one checking sources anymore?</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well, or they'rethey just look like the taglines, right?</p>
<p>They look at the clickbait, like, hereit is like,</p>
<p>I don't know, 80,000children are reported missing in a year.</p>
<p>That's true. That is true.</p>
<p>But how many actually were abducted?</p>
<p>Abducted.</p>
<p>So a small number.</p>
<p>I'm glad it's a small number. Me too.</p>
<p>I wish it was zero.</p>
<p>Yes, I wish it was zero zero.</p>
<p>I can't imagine the trauma and theoh of having your child attacked.</p>
<p>I can't even imagine or horrific.</p>
<p>But as a society, we'vewe've kind of injected a lot of fear.</p>
<p>Now, at the same time,</p>
<p>I would not do that.</p>
<p>And I asked why.</p>
<p>I asked our daughter Rachel,who has three children, seven, four and.</p>
<p>Two. Yeah.</p>
<p>I asked her.</p>
<p>Would she do that. Would she do that?</p>
<p>And she said, no, we would not do that.</p>
<p>Not not at an amusement park.</p>
<p>She would not leave her kids homealone and at a public place, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. They would not.</p>
<p>Okay. But if she was nine.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, maybe nine or ten.</p>
<p>Especially Emma, my oldest granddaughter.</p>
<p>Yes, he is.</p>
<p>Shout out to Emma. Yes.</p>
<p>He's so responsible for his man. Yes.</p>
<p>So maybe nine or ten. I mean, I don'tshe doesn't know Rachel didn't.</p>
<p>She's like she's not there yet.</p>
<p>I mean, she's not there.</p>
<p>So she was just like, right now.</p>
<p>No, I absolutely wouldn't leave.</p>
<p>Emma, who's seven, getting close to eight.</p>
<p>You wouldn't leave her with.</p>
<p>With Mitchell.</p>
<p>With the Mitchells, too.</p>
<p>But even with a newborn that she would.</p>
<p>Yeah. To go on a roller coaster.</p>
<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>So and so in that role that she put up,she waited until the parents came,which apparently, allegedlyit was 25 minutes.</p>
<p>And when the parent showedup, the parents,you know,she's yelling at the parents, Right.</p>
<p>Is being what they call a Karen. Right.</p>
<p>They the parents called her andthey wereshe was getting more and more angrybecause the parents were laughing at her.</p>
<p>They were just like,okay, like everything's fine.</p>
<p>You're like mine. You okay?</p>
<p>And they were laughing.</p>
<p>And she was just like,it was just you have that is,when you're mad and someone'slaughing at you, you're infuriated.</p>
<p>So it was just making her more in fury,hated. And.</p>
<p>But was it against the law, what they did?</p>
<p>No, no, I don't think it was like</p>
<p>SeaWorld's interests come out.</p>
<p>Well, there's also there's there'sthe question on was she being noseyor was being concernedand being a good citizen.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because there's a fine line there.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>There's a fineline of am I getting too involved?</p>
<p>But like I said to me,</p>
<p>I mean, I don't know this lady at all, butonce her camera came out,</p>
<p>I feel like she waswent from being less concerned and more.</p>
<p>Well, all right.</p>
<p>So I guess.</p>
<p>If we were concerned,what would we have done?</p>
<p>We IPRA So that would haveif I would have noticed that, yeah,</p>
<p>I probably would have stood offto the side watching it all play outto see if if I was neededand when are the parents coming.</p>
<p>And I probably would have done that.</p>
<p>I probably would not,unless that seven or two nine year oldlooked likethey were starting to freak out,then I probably would, but</p>
<p>I probably would have just stood aside.</p>
<p>And why?</p>
<p>Yes. And not chastise the parentswhen they come back.</p>
<p>I don't I'mnot really a chastising of people.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Like, I it's not really my thing.</p>
<p>I mean, I don't to.</p>
<p>School in in in this in this respectbeing a good persondoesn't mean you have to chastisesomeone else.</p>
<p>No, but.</p>
<p>You can be concerned and watch.</p>
<p>Right. And be cognizant. Yes.</p>
<p>So what's going onin case something did happen,like maybe the baby's having a hardtime. Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah. Or, you know, Yeah.</p>
<p>Then you could be there to help.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So I haveto call the police on someone before.</p>
<p>Which you have. Yes.</p>
<p>It was.</p>
<p>I went to, I think TJ Maxxprobably 12 or 13 years ago.</p>
<p>It was in the heat of the summer.</p>
<p>And I walked by this carand there is two little kids.</p>
<p>There's like a probably a six month oldand maybe a two and a half yearold in their car,buckled in their car, seats in the car.</p>
<p>And the windows were like,you know, a little bit rolled down.</p>
<p>Not too much because, you know,they don't want someone be ableto reach in and grab their child,but they want enough airthat's probably 85 degrees outside.</p>
<p>And so I went and got and the kids weren'tcrying when I walked by.</p>
<p>I went and got in my carand I waited for like 5 minutes.</p>
<p>No one came outand I called the police.</p>
<p>I called 911 because I had no ideahow long they had been sitting there.</p>
<p>But I knew it had been at least 5 minutes.</p>
<p>And to me, that's too long.</p>
<p>You should not be leavingyour babies in the car.</p>
<p>I mean,maybe if it was like one minute,if you had to run in and return a video.</p>
<p>Look, I'mgoing back to Blockbuster. On No block.</p>
<p>If you hadno right, of courseyou ran right back to your car.</p>
<p>Yes, I've done that.</p>
<p>Or run into the cleaners,grab your stuff. Ran right back.</p>
<p>Gone for a minute.</p>
<p>So the cops came.</p>
<p>By the time the cops came,it had been 15 minutesand the mom still hadn't come out right.</p>
<p>As the cops pulledin, the mom starts walking out. So.</p>
<p>So it had been a minimum of 15 minutesand they're talking to me.</p>
<p>And then she comes outand she was not happyat all that we should.</p>
<p>And I was like, You bet.</p>
<p>And then she's like,</p>
<p>I've only been there for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>And I'm like, Well, that is a liebecause it's been at least 15 minutes.</p>
<p>And anyway, and then I excused myselfand left her to talk to the police.</p>
<p>I have no idea what happenedbecause I don't want to be that nosy.</p>
<p>I there was nothing for me to do anymore,and I don't need to reprimand this mom.</p>
<p>So if there's this about 13 years ago,there were some very highprofile casesabout that time of some children dying.</p>
<p>All right. Because the same thing.</p>
<p>So do you think that influencedyour decision to do something</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, probably.</p>
<p>I mean, I just. Yes,because it was top of mind. Yeah.</p>
<p>Just seeing kids in a hot car,you know, it's kind of like I said,for longer because I was like, Oh,maybe she just ran in real quick.</p>
<p>But yeah, like I said, after 5 minutes,like all.</p>
<p>That, that reminds me of an old story of amy mom leaving us in the car.</p>
<p>But it was Christmas time. Yeah.</p>
<p>So not hot. Not hot. Right.</p>
<p>But we didn't have our shoes on because wemy mom was putting together aa Christmas party for my dad's office.</p>
<p>And as little kids,we took all the bulbs off the treeand threw them in the corner.</p>
<p>Naturally,we would do that. Yeah, we were.</p>
<p>We were. Yeah.</p>
<p>So my mom rounded uskids up, put us in the carand drove us to Longs</p>
<p>Drug and left us in the car.</p>
<p>And then she went in to get more ornament.</p>
<p>I would have left you inthe car as well. Well, yeah.</p>
<p>I would, but.</p>
<p>We didn't have. We both have a. Terriblechildren and.</p>
<p>We didn't have our shoes on or,you know, coatsbecause my mom just said I'm in a hurry,</p>
<p>I got to get this done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So my oldest sister, Darlene,</p>
<p>I'm spilling the tea.</p>
<p>So my family, if they're listening.</p>
<p>And Eileen, if you have the. Real truth.</p>
<p>The real truth,you call me and you tell meand I'll make sureit's on the next podcast.</p>
<p>He's if he's dialing,exaggerating the story.</p>
<p>Darlene takes myselfand I think Dana and we go into.</p>
<p>The hallway, How old are you?</p>
<p>I don't. Probably eight.</p>
<p>You were eight?</p>
<p>No, I was probably six.</p>
<p>Darlene was probably.</p>
<p>Eight. So eight. Six and and or four.</p>
<p>Okay. Right.</p>
<p>And the other kid,</p>
<p>I don't know where the other kids were.</p>
<p>Probably left at home with Alan. Yeah.</p>
<p>So we she holds us into long strug.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which is next to the mall and the mallcop comes up and says, Where's your mom?</p>
<p>She goes, Darlene told her she hates us.</p>
<p>She abandoned.</p>
<p>Oh, my. Yeah.</p>
<p>The deadliness. Oh, yeah. What the. Heck.</p>
<p>So, yeah,there's a whole story behind that.</p>
<p>Darlene, I need your rebuttal.</p>
<p>I need your rebuttal.</p>
<p>Oh, What?</p>
<p>Yeah. Oh, of course.</p>
<p>We didn't have our shoes on or coats.</p>
<p>So was your mom just beyond livid?</p>
<p>Well, they called over Longsdrugs and said, you know, asomeone have who's the parent of Darlene,</p>
<p>Darrin and Danaand my mom,he was livid.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear.</p>
<p>That's my recollection of the story.</p>
<p>She must have been really lividbecause the whole reason she wasthere was because you.</p>
<p>Because you broke all the ornaments.</p>
<p>Oh, my. So, yeah, I want to hear.</p>
<p>I want to hear this.</p>
<p>So this is your memory of it?</p>
<p>This is. My memory.</p>
<p>I don't remember the incident happening.</p>
<p>I kind of vaguely.</p>
<p>Yeah, but I rememberthe story being told several.</p>
<p>Okay, So. Yes.</p>
<p>So I want your mom and your sister. Okay.</p>
<p>Have to come.</p>
<p>On their version of events, but.</p>
<p>Okay, so. So let's talk. So.</p>
<p>So basically,</p>
<p>I think what we're getting down to isevery child is different,every act, right?</p>
<p>I mean, like some kids are readyto be left home alone at tenand some kids aren't ready to be left homealone until 12 or 14.</p>
<p>I don't you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Like, you have to make that decisionas a parent.</p>
<p>Well, and also,</p>
<p>I think the other thing is, is wewe need to not be so afraidof everything fine,because we infusethat fear into our childrenand they become paralyzed.</p>
<p>They can't make decisions.</p>
<p>They can't do things.</p>
<p>And just some accurate knowledgeor full knowledge.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Do a little bit of extra researchwhen you see a statisticbecause there's more behind.</p>
<p>It and maybe instead of</p>
<p>I mean, I hate using the word Karen,maybeinstead of us being parents to each other,how about</p>
<p>I mean, maybe we can extend our kindnessinstead of our wrath and our judgment?</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Like that.</p>
<p>So and so just. Standing there and. And.</p>
<p>Watching out quietlywithout any recognition.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let'ssee if these kids might need some help.</p>
<p>And in the parents get back,if you if you want to say, you know,hey, I just want you know,</p>
<p>I was hanging aroundparents might get mad at youor the parents might thank you, but.</p>
<p>Or say nothing if everything was okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p>I'm just saying,maybe if we had a little more kindnessin our heartsinstead of trying to be judgmental.</p>
<p>And and get some clickbait on the. Yes.</p>
<p>So I'm pretty. Yeah. No, I grewour lemonade moment of the week.</p>
<p>It's that time of year again.</p>
<p>Which</p>
<p>I cannot believe that this summer went byand the kids started school this weeklike, why.</p>
<p>Not all the kids start at school?</p>
<p>No, we have a junior and a senior,so our two boys started school this weekand it actually it it made me kind of sadbecause I felt like the summerwent by so fast that I was just like,</p>
<p>It's back to the rat race now.</p>
<p>I mean, I barely have seen Sam this weekbecause he went from school to work to,</p>
<p>I mean, like, yeah, and, you know,the other kids were at their mom's housethis week coming back over today.</p>
<p>So I didn'thave I wasn't missing themin the same way that I was missing Sam.</p>
<p>But yeah, it'skind of back to the rat race.</p>
<p>And and we're losing one child.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about that.</p>
<p>So that's the limits.</p>
<p>Our our oldest at home is getting readyto head out to college shortly.</p>
<p>And that's going to be.</p>
<p>Can be brutalbecause Paige will be outnumbered.</p>
<p>That sad day to lose my girl.</p>
<p>What am I going know is going to besurrounded by a bunch of boys?</p>
<p>Yeah. Very different. Right, Madeline?</p>
<p>How'd your day go?</p>
<p>And I actually get details, boys.</p>
<p>How'd your day go? Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, man. Okay.</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing else.</p>
<p>You're going to give me anything?</p>
<p>Anything at all?</p>
<p>I kind of had a talk with Sam todayand said,</p>
<p>I'm going to need a little more from you.</p>
<p>Like, if you know, Madeline's leaving meand I'm going to need you to talk to mesome more.</p>
